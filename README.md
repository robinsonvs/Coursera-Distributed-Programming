2. Client-server programming using Java's Socket and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) interfaces
3. Message-passing programming in Java using the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
4. Approaches to combine distribution with multithreading, including processes and threads, distributed actors, and reactive programming

This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. The First mini project exhibits __Page Rank with Spark__(https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Distributed-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week01/miniproject_1)
2. The Second mini project exhibits __File Server Using Sockets__
3. The Thrid mini project exhibits  __Distributed Matrix Multiply using Message Passing__
4. The Fourth mini project exhibits __Parallel File Server using Multithreading and Sockets__
