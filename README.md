## Distributed Programming Coursera #

### _This is the third and last course in [Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java Specialization by Rice University in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp)_

An introductory course of  Distributed Programming in Java by Rice university in Coursera 
Where I've learnt the follwing skills:
1. Distributed map-reduce programming in Java using the Hadoop and Spark frameworks
2. Client-server programming using Java's Socket and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) interfaces
3. Message-passing programming in Java using the Message Passing Interface (MPI)
4. Approaches to combine distribution with multithreading, including processes and threads, distributed actors, and reactive programming

This repository contains 4 mini-project with above mentioned technology, where
1. [__Page Rank with Spark__](https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Distributed-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week01/miniproject_1)
2. [__File Server Using Sockets__](https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Distributed-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week02/miniproject_2)
3. [__Distributed Matrix Multiply using Message Passing__](https://github.com/robinsonvs/Coursera-Distributed-Programming/tree/master/Solutions/week03/miniproject_3)
